Hello everyone!

This is a very simple currency converter which uses servlets.
It has 3 fanctionalities. 
1) Converts dynamically the currencies you want
by sending a post to google server.To do this you just compile the .java files that are
in the src folder and then create a folder with name classes/ in the WEB-INF/ directory.
Or you just create a new web application in netbeans and use them.
2) You can download a zip file with all
the project you have written.For this you have to compress your project to a zip 
file and put this zip file into you directory.It dependes which programma you use.
If you use NetBeans you have to put it in the web folder.If you use just Tomcat then 
you put the zip file in the same directory where WEB-INF/ is.
3) You can redirect to my webpage at wordpress or at the page you want. Just add the page at the 
web.xml file. The redirect happens with the use of a Listener.

That's all for now
